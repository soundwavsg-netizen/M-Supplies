# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

DETAILED INVENTORY DATA: Found 6 inventory items including Premium Polymailers variants (Purple, Apricot, Baby Blue) with proper stock levels and safety stock calculations. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The issue is NOT with the admin inventory API - it's working perfectly. The problem appears to be a data inconsistency where inventory items exist but corresponding product variants are missing from the products API (products show 0 variants each). This suggests the packing interface 'Failed to load inventory' error may be due to: 1) Frontend error handling when products have no variants, 2) Data synchronization issue between products and inventory, or 3) Frontend expecting different data structure. The backend admin inventory API is fully functional and ready for the packing interface to consume."

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The 'Failed to load inventory' error was caused by missing adminInventoryAPI export in frontend/src/lib/api.js.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: ‚úÖ Added complete adminInventoryAPI module to api.js with all inventory endpoints (list, get, adjust, etc.) ‚úÖ Frontend now compiles successfully without errors ‚úÖ Admin inventory API fully accessible from frontend. VERIFICATION: Backend API working correctly (6 inventory items), frontend compilation successful, all authentication and CORS properly configured.

      message: "üîç BABY BLUE PRODUCT STOCK AND PRICING DEBUG COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive analysis of Baby Blue product stock and pricing issues as specifically requested. CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: ‚ùå STOCK CALCULATION INCONSISTENCY: Found discrepancy between customer product listing (showing 'Out of Stock') and admin inventory (showing stock available). ROOT CAUSE: ProductService.list_products() method only checked 'stock_qty' field for stock calculation, but Baby Blue variants had on_hand=25 and stock_qty=0. The list_products_filtered() method correctly used 'on_hand' field, creating inconsistency. SOLUTION: Updated ProductService.list_products() line 155 to check both stock_qty and on_hand fields: 'any(v.get('stock_qty', 0) > 0 or v.get('on_hand', 0) > 0 for v in variants)'. TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ Baby Blue product found with 2 variants (50pcs and 100pcs) ‚úÖ Stock quantities verified: both variants have on_hand=25, stock_qty=0 ‚úÖ Different pack size pricing working correctly: 50pcs=$7.99, 100pcs=$14.99 (NOT same $14.99 as reported) ‚úÖ Admin inventory correctly shows available stock ‚úÖ Customer now sees 'In Stock' after fix ‚úÖ Stock calculation consistency restored between listing and detail views. CONCLUSION: The reported issue 'admin shows Out of Stock when customer shows In Stock' was actually the opposite - customer was showing Out of Stock while admin showed stock available. This has been RESOLVED. The pricing issue of both variants showing $14.99 could NOT be reproduced - they correctly show different prices. Success rate: 100% (18/18 tests passed)."

      message: "üö® BABY BLUE PRICING STRUCTURE ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Conducted comprehensive debug of Baby Blue product variant pricing as specifically requested. CRITICAL FINDING: ‚ùå PRICING STRUCTURE DEFECT FOUND: The 100-pack variant has a problematic price_tiers structure that causes frontend display issues. CURRENT STRUCTURE: [{'min_quantity': 25, 'price': 14.99}, {'min_quantity': 50, 'price': 7.99}, {'min_quantity': 100, 'price': 14.99}]. ISSUE: First tier starts at quantity 25, leaving quantities 1-24 without proper pricing tier. Frontend defaults to first tier price ($14.99) for small quantities. TESTING RESULTS: ‚úÖ 50-pack variant: Shows $9.99 correctly ‚ùå 100-pack variant: Shows $14.99 for quantities 1-49 (should show $7.99 base price) ‚úÖ Backend APIs working correctly ‚úÖ Price tier arrays are independent (not shared) ‚úÖ Admin updates work correctly. ROOT CAUSE: Price tier structure missing min_quantity=1 tier for 100-pack variant. RECOMMENDED FIX: Add {'min_quantity': 1, 'price': 7.99} as first tier, or restructure pricing logic. This explains why user sees both variants showing $14.99 in customer view - the 100-pack variant defaults to $14.99 for typical small quantity purchases."
