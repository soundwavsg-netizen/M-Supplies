# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

DETAILED INVENTORY DATA: Found 6 inventory items including Premium Polymailers variants (Purple, Apricot, Baby Blue) with proper stock levels and safety stock calculations. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The issue is NOT with the admin inventory API - it's working perfectly. The problem appears to be a data inconsistency where inventory items exist but corresponding product variants are missing from the products API (products show 0 variants each). This suggests the packing interface 'Failed to load inventory' error may be due to: 1) Frontend error handling when products have no variants, 2) Data synchronization issue between products and inventory, or 3) Frontend expecting different data structure. The backend admin inventory API is fully functional and ready for the packing interface to consume."

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The 'Failed to load inventory' error was caused by missing adminInventoryAPI export in frontend/src/lib/api.js. Frontend logs showed compilation error: 'adminInventoryAPI is not exported from @/lib/api'. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: ‚úÖ Added complete adminInventoryAPI module to api.js with all inventory endpoints (list, get, adjust, etc.) ‚úÖ Frontend now compiles successfully without errors ‚úÖ Admin inventory API fully accessible from frontend. VERIFICATION: Backend API working correctly (6 inventory items), frontend compilation successful, all authentication and CORS properly configured.

DETAILED ERROR ANALYSIS: The 422 error shows exactly 4 missing required fields: ['body -> type', 'body -> value', 'body -> valid_from', 'body -> valid_to']. SOLUTION VERIFIED: ‚úÖ Corrected schema works perfectly - created coupon successfully with proper field mapping ‚úÖ Both 'percent' and 'fixed' discount types working ‚úÖ All validation rules working correctly.

FINDINGS: ‚ùå PRICE RANGE $0 ISSUE CONFIRMED: Found 'Premium Polymailers - Baby blue' showing price range $0.0 - $7.99 in GET /api/products.

USER ISSUE REPRODUCED: Customer product page showing 'Out of Stock' with no variant selection dropdown for Baby Blue product (ID: 6084a6ff-1911-488b-9288-2bc95e50cafa). ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: ‚úÖ Baby Blue product exists in database with correct structure ‚úÖ Product Details API working correctly ‚ùå CRITICAL FINDING: Baby Blue product has 0 variants - this explains the missing dropdown and 'Out of Stock' status.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE: The system correctly shows 'Out of Stock' because there are no variants to purchase, and no dropdown appears because there are no variants to select from.
