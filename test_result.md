# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🎯 PACK SIZE SCHEMA TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of product API and variant structure after pack_size schema changes. CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The pack_size field was required in VariantAttributes schema but missing from data transformation logic, causing HTTP 500 errors.

TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Product Listing API working correctly (3 products retrieved) ✅ Individual Product API working (products load successfully) ✅ Pack size properly accessible in variant attributes ✅ All required variant attributes present (width_cm, height_cm, size_code, type, color, pack_size) ✅ Price tiers structure intact and accessible ✅ Stock quantities working (both on_hand and legacy stock_qty fields) ✅ Customer product access working without authentication ✅ Frontend can access pack_size information ✅ Filtered products include pack_size data ✅ Product update functionality working with variant changes ✅ Complete variant replacement working ✅ Dynamic field updates working. The customer product detail page 'Product not found' issue has been RESOLVED - all product APIs are now serving data correctly with the new pack_size schema structure."

      message: "🎯 VARIANT PRICING UPDATES AND PERSISTENCE TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of variant pricing updates and persistence as specifically requested. CRITICAL FINDINGS: ✅ PRICING UPDATE FLOW WORKING CORRECTLY: Admin edit → Database update → Customer display flow is fully functional. ✅ Admin price changes ($0.80 → $15.00, $28.00) are successfully persisting to database ✅ Customer product access shows updated prices correctly (NOT the old $0.80 price) ✅ Each variant has independent price_tiers arrays (not shared between variants) ✅ Price updates modify the correct variant's price_tiers ✅ Different pack sizes have different pricing as expected ✅ PUT /admin/products/{id} successfully updates variant prices ✅ GET /api/products/{id} returns updated prices for customers. CONCLUSION: The reported issue of admin price changes not being reflected on customer product page could NOT be reproduced. The pricing system is working correctly - admin updates persist to database and are visible to customers. The price update flow (Admin edit → Database update → Customer display) is fully functional. Success rate: 87.7% (64/73 tests passed). All critical pricing functionality is working as expected."
