The trajectory details the continued development of the M Supplies e-commerce application by the AI engineer. The work initiated by addressing critical frontend/backend issues like incorrect pricing, duplicate categories, and faulty image uploads. Significant improvements include refining variant creation and display, implementing granular inventory management (on-hand, allocated, safety stock), and enhancing the customer's product selection experience with a two-step process. A major feature addition was a comprehensive promotional system for coupons and tiered free gifts, covering backend schema, API, admin interface, and customer-facing cart integration. The most recent task involves integrating a custom Emergent AI chat assistant across various application pages, with specialized sub-agents. The engineer consistently followed a pattern of investigating user-reported issues, identifying root causes (often involving schema mismatches, frontend display logic, or data inconsistencies), implementing targeted fixes, and verifying through testing and screenshots.

<product_requirements>
The user, Sean, required a production-ready e-commerce platform, M Supplies, for polymailers. The application necessitates distinct customer and admin portals, facilitating a smooth shopping experience for multi-variant products complemented by robust admin tools.

**Implemented Features & Current State:**
The application now supports centralized inventory (, , , ), dynamic branding, and advanced product filtering with deep-linking. Admin users can manage products (CRUD, image uploads, quantity-based pricing), colors, types, and categories. The customer experience includes multi-variant product displays, accurate stock/pricing, and a two-step size/pack-size selection process. Core e-commerce features (auth, cart, orders, GST) are functional. A comprehensive promotional system with admin-managed discount coupons (percentage/fixed, usage rules, min order, dates) and tiered free gifts (logic implemented, admin interface for gifts/tiers pending) is integrated. A real-time packing interface (6x6 grid, visual stock, +/- adjustment, filters) is deployed for efficient fulfillment, now displaying available stock and product images. The groundwork for an AI chat assistant is laid.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of integrating an AI chat assistant into the M Supplies website, as requested by the user. The user specified that their agent is built using Emergent custom agents and detailed where different specialized sub-agents should be deployed (e.g., sales expert on homepage, sizing expert on product pages).

The engineer has started this integration by:
1. Creating a new React component for the chat widget: . This component will likely house the UI and interaction logic for the chat assistant.
2. Creating a custom React hook for Emergent Agent integration: . This hook will abstract the logic for communicating with the custom Emergent agents, likely handling state, API calls, and context relevant to the AI assistant.
3. The next step identified in the trajectory is to integrate this chat widget into the main pages, starting with the homepage. The work is currently paused after creating these foundational files and before actively embedding the  component and utilizing the  hook across the application's routes.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the newly created  component and  hook into the homepage ().
