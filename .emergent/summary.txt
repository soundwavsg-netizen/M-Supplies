The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the M Supplies application from an MVP to a more robust, feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on critical bug fixes like a frontend compilation error, followed by comprehensive product filtering, branding enhancements with dynamic logos, and robust admin product management. Key achievements include deep-linkable product filtering, dynamic image uploads, and conditional quantity-based pricing. A significant portion of the recent work involved debugging and refining core features. The engineer systematically addressed multiple user-reported issues, including an authentication error during product updates, ensuring data persistence for variants and dynamic options (colors, types, categories), resolving a React child runtime error, implementing flexible pack-size logic for variants, fixing customer-facing pricing and stock displays, and finally, rectifying product deletion cascades and enabling granular allocated inventory management. Each problem was investigated, root causes identified, and solutions implemented with thorough testing and user feedback loops.

Conditional quantity-based pricing tiers (25, 50, 100 pcs; 50, 100 for Premium Polymailers; 1, 5, 10, etc. for Bubble Wrap sold by pieces). Product-level color, type, and category selection with variant attributes representing dimensions and pack size. Dynamic management (add/delete) of available colors, types, and categories globally via settings. Edit and delete functionality for products and individual variants with confirmation. Add New Product and Manage Products buttons on admin inventory page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a series of critical inventory and product management issues based on user feedback.

1.  **Dynamic SKU Count on Admin Dashboard**: The hardcoded 38 SKUs on the  dashboard was replaced with a dynamic count that reflects the actual number of active product variants in the system.
2.  **Product Deletion Cascade**: The product deletion functionality was enhanced to perform a complete cleanup. Previously, deleting a product would only soft-delete the product itself, leaving its variants and associated inventory records intact. Now, deleting a product also explicitly deletes all its associated variants from the database.
3.  **Inventory View Filtering**: The  API endpoint was modified to retrieve and display only *active* products and their variants, ensuring that deleted items do not clutter the inventory view.
4.  **Allocated Stock Management**: The concept of Allocated stock (stock reserved for pending orders) was clarified. An interface was added to the  page's  allowing administrators to explicitly adjust both On Hand and Allocated quantities. This enables real-time management of stock reservations. The backend  and  schema were updated to support these granular adjustments.

These changes were thoroughly tested, and the system now correctly handles product deletions, provides accurate SKU counts, and offers full control over inventory allocation.
