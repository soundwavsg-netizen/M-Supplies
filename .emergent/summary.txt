<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical authentication error during product updates. The user reported, Error when update product. It says could not validate credentials.

The AI engineer investigated the backend logs and confirmed multiple  responses, indicating a JWT token issue. This implies the token is either expired, missing from the request, or invalid. The system successfully logs in and fetches product data, but fails on modification operations.

This issue surfaced after extensive work on the admin product management, which included:
-   Implementing dynamic image upload in .
-   Refactoring pricing tiers to be quantity-based (25, 50, or 100 pcs, with conditional logic for Premium Polymailers).
-   Restructuring product creation/editing to have product-level  and  fields, with variants representing only .
-   Adding dynamic  and  functionality within the .
-   Implementing comprehensive product and variant deletion with confirmation dialogs.
-   Fixing a previous  error by updating the backend  and  schemas in  to include , , , and .

The 401 error suggests an underlying problem with how the frontend handles or sends the authentication token for PUT requests, potentially an expiration or incorrect header attachment, which was not the focus of the previous schema and UI changes.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the 401 Unauthorized error by checking JWT token handling in the frontend for PUT requests.
