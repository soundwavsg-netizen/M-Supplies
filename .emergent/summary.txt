The AI engineer's work on M Supplies involved several development phases. Initially, it addressed core e-commerce functionalities like inventory management, variant creation, and a promotional system for coupons and gifts. A significant focus was integrating a context-aware AI chat assistant across various application pages. Subsequently, GST was removed, a basic weight-based shipping system was implemented, and essential informational pages (About Us, FAQ, Contact Us) were added. The engineer also redesigned user profile, address, and order management to be Firebase-compatible. Email notifications for user signup and contact form submissions were integrated using SendGrid. Finally, comprehensive SEO metadata, structured data, a sitemap, and robots.txt were implemented. The trajectory concluded with the creation and provision of a standalone demo page component for the M Supplies application to be used as a portfolio piece on another website. The engineer consistently debugged issues across frontend and backend, ensuring functional and robust features.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on a user request to provide the M Supplies chatbot functionality for their *other* Emergent-built website (CCC website). The initial request was to embed the chatbot widget, but the user clarified that they needed a *complete new page* to showcase M Supplies as a portfolio demo piece on their CCC website.

In response, the AI engineer delivered the entire React component code for a standalone demo page, named . This comprehensive component is designed to present the M Supplies platform's key features, technical stack, and business impact. It includes sections detailing:
